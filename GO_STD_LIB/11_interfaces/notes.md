### Type Assertion vs Type Convertion

* Type assertions can be applied only to interfaces, and they are used to tell the compiler that an interface value has a specific dynamic type. Type conversions can be applied only to specific types, not interfaces, and only if the structure of those types is compatible, such as converting between struct types that have the same fields.
